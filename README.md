# Professional-README-Generator

## Task

I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

This application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Description

When the user is prompted for information about their application repository a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of their project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

When the user enters their project title it is displayed as the title of the README.

When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions that information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

When the user chooses a license for their application from a list of options a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

When the user enters their GitHub username it is then added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

When the user enters their email address it is then added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
